## üî≠ About Me
I‚Äôm a software engineer transitioning into data analysis, specializing in building reproducible analytics pipelines, exploratory and inferential analysis, and production-ready data products. I enjoy taking ambiguous business questions, turning them into testable hypotheses, and shipping solutions that stakeholders actually use.

- Location: India  
- Primary tools: Python, SQL, Jupyter, Git  
- Current focus: Time series forecasting, feature engineering for tabular data, and end-to-end data workflows

### Programming & Data
- **Languages:** Python (advanced), SQL (advanced), R (familiar)
- **Data libraries:** pandas, numpy, scipy
- **Machine learning:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, basic TensorFlow / PyTorch experience
- **Statistics & ML foundations:** hypothesis testing, A/B testing, cross-validation, model evaluation, bias-variance tradeoff

### Data Engineering & Storage
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
- **BigQuery / Data warehouses:** (conceptual / practical experience)
- **ETL / workflows:** Airflow concepts, cron jobs, scripting for reproducible pipelines
- **Containers & reproducibility:** Docker, virtualenv / poetry

### Visualization & Reporting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Approach
1. **Problem framing:** translate business questions into measurable objectives and KPIs.  
2. **Data audit & quality checks:** automated validation, null handling, and provenance tracking.  
3. **Exploration & feature engineering:** hypothesis-driven EDA with clear visual narratives.  
4. **Modeling & evaluation:** baseline ‚Üí tuned models with robust cross-validation and bias checks.  
5. **Delivery:** reproducible pipelines, concise dashboards, and executive-friendly reports.  
6. **Post-deploy monitoring:** performance drift checks, retraining triggers, and clear rollback plans.

## üìà Metrics I Care About
- Forecast accuracy (MAPE / RMSE) and business-aligned error metrics  
- Uplift and incremental revenue from experiments  
- Data freshness and pipeline reliability (MTTR / MTBF)  
- Time-to-insight: how quickly a question becomes a reproducible answer
